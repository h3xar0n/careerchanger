I majored in Philosophy because I enjoyed logic and abstract problem-solving. My first job  sent me to India to help create 2 American schools, first by using my background in philosophy to combine several different curricula. After getting approval from the government to open, I also did most of the marketing and logistics for the schools. 

I came back to San Francisco and started working with small tech companies, applying the startup skills I’d gained in India. Through that network, I eventually got to work with Apple for WWDC 3 years in a row. One of the executives saw me editing a deck once and joked about how it seemed very similar to debugging code. “One tiny bug, and the whole presentation would lose its focus.”

I got more involved in editing, and after other stints in India and Canada, I ended up in New York where I met my wife. Like my father, she was an immigrant from the former USSR with an incredible entrepreneurial drive. When I saw how she started her own business, I was inspired to give it a shot and co-founded an HR company, Gameplan Jobs. Then, to help build her website and my own, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made a great site for her that generated a ton of leads and automated her scheduling, but my own site was dynamic and I still hadn’t learned server-side scripting yet. I hired other developers, but felt I needed to improve my skills even more. 

While learning Ruby, I discovered that coding was far more fulfilling for me than the business side of things, and a lot more interesting than editing English. I took the leap by signing up for CareerFoundry’s class and am excited to start my new career as a web developer.
